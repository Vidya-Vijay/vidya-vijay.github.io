  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Built a simulated SQL-based relational database system to manage operations in a chemical production plant, supporting roles like plant managers, 
    QA teams, and inventory staff. The system automates production batch scheduling, raw material tracking, order processing, and payment management, 
    demonstrating end-to-end database design and optimization skills.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Business Context</h2>
  <p>Chemical production plants rely on accurate inventory, production, and order data. Without a structured database, managers face inefficiencies, 
    errors in scheduling, and delays in customer order fulfillment. This simulated project demonstrates the ability to design systems that optimize operations and ensure data integrity, even in complex multi-entity environments.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>Design a database system that ensures data integrity, reduces redundancy, and provides managers and staff with reliable tools to monitor production, inventory, and customer orders efficiently.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tools & Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools: MySQL, phpMyAdmin</li>
    <li>Techniques: Relational Modeling, Normalization (2NF), Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), 
      DDL & DML, SQL Query Optimization, JOINs, GROUP BY, Subqueries, Aggregations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Features/Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>Normalized Schema Design:</strong> Created 10+ interrelated tables in 2NF with clear functional dependencies to reduce redundancy and ensure integrity.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Entity Relationship Diagram:</strong> Mapped entities like Raw_Material, Supplier, Product, Order, Customer, and Payment using Chen’s notation.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Relational Mapping:</strong> Used bridge tables (Product_Material, Order_Details) to model M:N relationships.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>DDL & Implementation: </strong>Built schema using MySQL and implemented all relationships with appropriate data types, constraints, and indexing for query efficiency.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>SQL Queries:</strong> Developed advanced queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries, and aggregation to generate reports on order status, raw material usage, and customer payments.</span></li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  
    <li>Achieved a fully operational MySQL-backed system for inventory control and production monitoring.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated real-world application of relational modeling, normalization, SQL optimization, and database design principles.</li>
    <li>Received positive feedback for completeness, performance, and clarity of schema design.</li>  
<p>Overall, this project strengthened my practical skills in database design, normalization, and SQL optimization, while giving me hands-on experience in managing data integrity, implementing relational logic, and confidently translating business requirements into efficient, data-driven solutions.
