  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Analyzed 6 months of Netflix viewership data across 240 titles to identify what drives engagement. 
    Integrated IMDb ratings, award data, and global availability to uncover statistical relationships and guide content strategy decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Business Context</h2>
  <p>
    Streaming platforms like Netflix need to optimize content promotion and acquisition. 
    Understanding which factors drive viewership helps improve recommendations, increase engagement, and allocate marketing resources effectively.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Determine key drivers of Netflix content viewership, quantify their impact, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance engagement and guide content strategy.
    
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Netflix viewership data (6 months, 240 titles)</li>
    <li>IMDb ratings, award wins and nominations</li>
    <li>Global availability & metadata from Wikipedia</li>
   
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools: IBM SPSS, Minitab, Microsoft Excel, Tableau</li>
    <li>Techniques: Multiple Linear Regression, One-Way ANOVA, Two-Way ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, 
      Dummy Variable Encoding, Residual Diagnostics</li>   
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>1. Cleaned and merged datasets from multiple sources</p>
    <p>2. Explored viewership trends across type (Movie vs. Series), genre, and rating</p>  
    <p>3. Built regression models to quantify impact of content attributes on viewership</p>  
    <p>4. Conducted ANOVA to test differences across genres and interaction effects</p>
    <p>5. Designed Tableau dashboards to visualize insights and trends</p>
 </section>

 <section>
  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <p><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong></p>
    <li>Positive drivers: IMDb rating, award nominations</li>   
    <li>Type and genre significantly influence viewership</li>
    <li>R² = 0.339 → other factors also play a role</li>
    <li>Residual diagnostics indicated heteroscedasticity and outliers</li>
    <p><strong>ANOVA:</strong></p>
    <li>Action is the most-watched genre; Anime the least</li>
    <li>Genre significantly affects viewership averages</li>
    <p><strong>Two-Way ANOVA:</strong></p>
    <li>Type × Genre interaction is significant: Movies outperform series in the sample</li>
    <li>Engagement depends on content combination, not just individual attributes</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Business Recommendations</h2>
  <li>Promote high-engagement genres like Action and Thriller in recommendations</li>
  <li>Support underperforming genres (Anime, Comedy) with targeted campaigns or cross-genre content</li>
  <li>Leverage award nominations & ratings to highlight content that drives viewer engagement</li>
  <li>Optimize type/genre combination for content placement in the recommendation engine</li>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusion & Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis confirms that both content type and genre significantly shape Netflix viewership. 
    While regression models had some limitations, they still provide meaningful insight into what drives engagement. 
	These findings can support content strategy, especially around boosting underperforming 
	genres or promoting viewer-preferred content types.
  </p> 
  <p>This project strengthened my skills in statistical modeling, diagnostic test interpretation, 
    and multivariate analysis. It provided hands-on experience in evaluating interaction effects and translating statistical results 
    into actionable business insights. Through this analysis, I developed a deeper understanding of audience segmentation and data-driven content strategy optimization in the streaming industry.
