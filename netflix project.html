  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project explores the factors that influence how much a show or movie is watched on Netflix. 
    Using data from Netflix, IMDb, and Wikipedia, we analyzed 6 months of viewership trends across 240 titles using statistical techniques 
    like multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and chi-square tests. 
    he study aimed to support better content recommendation strategies by examining factors that impact watch time, such as IMDb ratings, awards, and global availability.

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Viewership is positively influenced by IMDb ratings 
	and award nominations. Type and Genre also play key roles.</li>
  <li>R² of 0.339 suggests other unexplored factors may influence viewership.</li>
  <li>Residual plots indicated issues with heteroscedasticity and outliers. </li>
    <li><strong>ANOVA:</strong> Viewership varies significantly by genre — 
	Action leads, while Anime has the lowest average.</li>
  <li>Action was the most preferred genre, followed by Thriller and Horror.</li>
    <li><strong>Two-Way ANOVA:</strong> Type (Movie vs. Series) and Genre 
	both significantly affect viewership, and they interact together.</li>
  <li>Movies were more popular than series in the observed sample</li>



    <!--<li><strong>Chi-Square:</strong> There is a clear preference for Movies over Series, 
	and for the Action genre over others.</li> -->
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion & Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis confirms that both content type and genre significantly shape Netflix viewership. 
    While regression models had some limitations, they still provide meaningful insight into what drives engagement. 
	These findings can support content strategy, especially around boosting underperforming 
	genres or promoting viewer-preferred content types.
  </p> 
  <p>This project strengthened my skills in statistical modeling, diagnostic test interpretation, 
    and multivariate analysis. It provided hands-on experience in evaluating interaction effects and translating statistical results 
    into actionable business insights. Through this analysis, I developed a deeper understanding of audience segmentation and data-driven content strategy optimization in the streaming industry.
