  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
   Partnered with a local Thai restaurant experiencing declining revenue and customer satisfaction. 
   Conducted an end-to-end analysis using sales, weather, and customer review data to identify key performance drivers and 
   recommend actionable strategies to improve business outcomes.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Business Context</h2>
  <p>
   The restaurant faced inconsistent daily revenue, declining customer satisfaction, and limited visibility into the factors 
   influencing sales performance. Without structured analysis, decision-making relied heavily on intuition rather than data.
  </p>
</section>

  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>SQL & Python (Pandas) </strong>- Data cleaning and integration</span> </li>
    <li><span><strong>Power BI (DAX) </strong> - Interactive dashboard development</span> </li>
    <li><span><strong>Regression Modeling </strong> -  Revenue prediction</span> </li>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Merged structured and unstructured data sources to create a unified dataset</li>
  <li>Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends and anomalies</li>
  <li>Built a multiple linear regression model to predict daily revenue based on external factors</li>   
  <li>Analyzed customer sentiment to understand service quality issues</li>   
  <li>Designed an interactive dashboard to support real-time decision-making</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>Revenue was highly influenced by external factors,</strong> 
      with warmer temperatures and holidays significantly increasing sales.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Thursdays consistently underperformed,</strong> indicating untapped demand during weekdays.</span></li>
    <li><span>Positive reviews highlighted <strong>“friendly service” and “food quality” </strong>as key loyalty drivers.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Negative feedback frequently mentioned service issues,</strong> indicating operational gaps</span></li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Business Recommendations</h2>

    <p>Implement outdoor seating or seasonal promotions during high-temperature periods</p>
    <li><strong>Improve Service Quality</strong> </li>
    <p>Provide staff retraining and introduce feedback systems (e.g., QR-based surveys)</p>
    <li><strong>Enhance Customer Experience</strong> </li>
    <p>Focus on service consistency, as it directly impacts tipping behavior and satisfaction</p>
    <li><strong>Use Predictive Insights for Planning </strong></li>
