  <h1>Reviving Restaurant Sales: A Data-Driven Approach Using Predictive Analytics and Business Insights</h1>
  <p>A predictive analytics project to support a local Thai restaurant's business turnaround</p>
</header>

<p><strong>Course:</strong> BUS 424 – Customer Intelligence<br>

<section>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
   Partnered with a family-owned Thai restaurant in Abbotsford facing declining sales and customer satisfaction. 
   Leveraged 313 days of structured sales, weather, and calendar data plus 400+ Google reviews to diagnose issues, 
   predict sales, and design targeted interventions, aiming to reverse revenue decline and improve customer loyalty.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<u1>
  <li>Built an end-to-end analytics solution integrating structured (POS sales, weather) and unstructured (Google reviews) datasets.</li>
  <li>Cleaned and merged multi-source data using <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong> Python.</strong></li>
  <li>Designed interactive <strong>Power BI</strong> dashboards with dynamic filters, KPI cards, and storytelling visuals to guide owner decisions.</li> 
  <li>Developed a <strong>Multiple Linear Regression model (RMSE: 276.99)</strong> to predict daily revenue based on temperature, day-of-week, and holidays.</li>
  <li>Used <strong>NLP & sentiment analysis (NLTK)</strong> to correlate customer tone with tipping behavior, identifying a 20% drop in tips following staff changes.</li>
  <li>Created <strong>word clouds</strong> revealing “delicious” & “friendly” as loyalty drivers, while “messed” & “disappointed” flagged service gaps.</li>
  
</u1>

    It identifies monthly dips in revenue and seasonal shifts helping uncover key operational insights.</p>

<p>Built using Power BI Desktop with DAX measures, KPI cards and custom themes, this dashboard is optimized for 
  executive review with a warm, culturally inspired design that supports storytelling and decision-making.</p>

  <h2>Key Insights Driving Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Slow Thursdays:</strong> Lowest sales; recommended weekday lunch specials & event tie-ins.</li>
    <li><strong>Weather sensitivity:</strong> Warm days + holidays spiked revenue; proposed outdoor seating promotion during warm seasons.</li>
    <li>Negative customer sentiment grew after staff changes and linked to lower tips</li>
    <li><strong>Staff sentiment link:</strong> Negative reviews post-staff change directly tied to tipping decline; 
      advised service retraining + private QR feedback channel.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Business Impact Potential</h2>
  <p> Projected 10–15% revenue uplift through targeted promotions, sentiment-driven feedback loops, and operational optimization, 
    all achievable with minimal overhead for the owner.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Overall, this project strengthened my skills in data storytelling, model validation, 
  and translating business problems into analytical solutions, while also reinforcing the power of analytics in small business decision-making.
